This page contains the common code snippets used to installing and setup MySQL server initially on your personal machine.

## Mac
If you have homebrew

```

## Windows

Figure out yourselves :P


## Setting up database and user

### Creating new database

```mysql
create database newdatabase;
```

### Creating new user

mysql -u newuser -p
```
