I was introduced to the Open Source world almost 2 years ago. And the idea behid open source project and softwares excites me and started using open source softwares like 
Type Theme is a free and open-source theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), licensed under the MIT License.

Head over to the [theme's documentation](https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type/) for much more information about Type Theme or to install this theme on your own Jekyll site.

This file is an example of a page in Jekyll, that automatically shows up in the header navigation, you can delete or modify this file freely.
