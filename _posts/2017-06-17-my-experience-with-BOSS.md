## BOSS Experience


This summer has been quite hectic for me. 

I started applying for internship programmes and other open source programmes for the summer, quite early.
I had been a contributor for the past one year, but have been contributing to small code-bases on Algorithms.

So I wanted to get involved in an open source community and started applying for **GSOC**.


And then I got to work with [SunPy](http://sunpy.org/) , an organisation working on Solar Physics software tools for GSOC. It was around this time that I worked extensively on Open Source,
contributing to such a large code base and being active on the IRC channel.

But unfortunately , I didn't get selected for GSOC as my project was not given a slot by Google , this year. 

I tried my best and I felt bad about it. I thought that there were no other Open Source events like GSOC and I really wanted to be a part of such an event.

------------------------------------------

But then I came upon BOSS.

**Bountiful Open Source Summer**

As the name suggests, an open source event just like GSOC  - this was great. 

I was excited. This summer isn't gonna be boring.

One thing that I liked about BOSS is that it is open to all. 

A **Real Open Source Event**

It has no registration process and anyone can start participating at any time within the referred period. Unlike GSOC, you don't have to write an application for
a given project work and I find it really irrelevant. 
So BOSS stands out and I am really excited this summer to contribute to such a host of great projects under coding-blocks.

I first started working on the issues that didn't require much understanding of the whole code-base. Usually they had smaller bounty points. 

Then as time went by , I went on to solve bigger issues - **more bounty points**. 

Some of the issues were simple , while others made a big impact on the respective code-base. 

And when people come to a place to solve a specific bug or issue which has been active for the past 2 - 3 weeks , and finally solve it, it is that
joy of Open Source that you get.



It has been quite a great experience so far. I have been contributing for the past 2 weeks besides doing an internship at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

A cup of coffee, a good network connection and that's how I go on Open Sourcing.

So, for all the new contributors willing to participate in BOSS.

What are you waiting for?

Pull a request here and you are welcome to BOSS.

Get Started, because this summer is going to be **Bountifully Amazing**.
