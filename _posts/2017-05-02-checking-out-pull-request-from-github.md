So your repository got a PR from a enthusiastic developer. You don’t want to
merge it before testing it out yourself locally on your dev machine. How do you
go about it ?

The pull request is available on this git ref `pull/{*ID}*/head` which you can
fetch using this, where ID is the pull request id.

    git fetch origin pull/
    /head && git checkout FETCH_HEAD

Or, if you only want to cherry pick it, instead of checking it out, you can use

    git fetch origin pull/
    /head && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
